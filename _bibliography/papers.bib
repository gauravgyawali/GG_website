	abstract = "Approximating the ground states of strongly interacting electron systems in quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics is expected to be one of the earliest applications of quantum computers. In this paper, we prepare highly accurate ground states of the Fermi-Hubbard model for small grids up to 6 sites (12 qubits) by using an interpretable, adaptive variational quantum eigensolver(VQE) called ADAPT-VQE. In contrast with non-adaptive VQE, this algorithm builds a system-specific ansatz by adding an optimal gate built from one-body or two-body fermionic operators at each step. We show this adaptive method outperforms the non-adaptive counterpart in terms of fewer variational parameters, short gate depth, and scaling with the system size. The fidelity and energy of the prepared state appear to improve asymptotically with ansatz depth. We also demonstrate the application of adaptive variational methods by preparing excited states and Green functions using a proposed ADAPT-SSVQE algorithm. Lower depth, asymptotic convergence, noise tolerance of a variational approach, and a highly controllable, system-specific ansatz make the adaptive variational methods particularly well-suited for NISQ devices."

	title = {Glass phenomenology in the hard matrix model},
	ABSTRACT = "We introduce a new toy model for the study of glasses: the hardmatrix model (HMM). This may be viewed as a single particle moving on SO(N),
where there is a potential proportional to the 1-norm of the matrix. The ground
states of the model are “crystals” where all matrix elements have the same
magnitude. These are the Hadamard matrices when N is divisible by four.
Just as finding the latter has challenged mathematicians, our model fails to
find them upon cooling and instead shows all the behaviors that characterize
physical glasses. With simulations we have located the first-order crystallization
temperature, the Kauzmann temperature where the glass would have the same
entropy as the crystal, as well as the standard, measurement-time dependent
glass transition temperature. Our model also brings to light a new kind of
elementary excitation special to the glass phase: the rubicon. In our model these
are associated with the finite density of matrix elements near zero, the maximum
in their contribution to the energy. Rubicons enable the system to cross between
basins without thermal activation, a possibility not much discussed in the standard
landscape picture. We use these modes to explain the slow dynamics in our model
and speculate about their role in its quantum extension in the context of manybody localization."

	ABSTRACT = "A model for carboxylic acids, in both the protonated and deprotonated states, is developed in which hydrogen interaction sites are not used and all interactions are short-ranged. A method for constant pH simulations, which exploits these features of the model, is developed. The constant pH method samples protonation states by making discrete Monte Carlo steps and is able to efficiently move between states in two steps. The method is applied to the polymer poly(methacrylic acid), a pH-responsive polymer that undergoes structural changes as a function of pH. The model is able to reproduce the structural changes induced by pH."}

	ABSTRACT = {Thermoresponsive polymers can change structure or solubility as a function of temperature. Block co-polymers of polyethers have a response that depends on polymer molecular weight and co-polymer composition. A coarse-grained model for aqueous polyethers is developed and applied to polyethylene oxide and polyethylene oxide-polypropylene oxide-polyethylene oxide triblock co-polymers. In this model, no interaction sites on hydrogen atoms are included, no Coulombic interactions are present, and all interactions are short-ranged, treated with a combination of two- and three-body terms. Our simulations find that The triblock co-polymers tend to associate at temperatures above 350 K. The aggregation is stabilized by contact between The hydrophobic methyl groups on The propylene oxide monomers and involves a large, favorable change in entropy.},

	ABSTRACT ="A model for linear alkanes is presented in which interaction sites are only on the carbon atoms, and the range of the potential is reduced using the Stillinger–Weber potential. The model is optimized for aqueous and liquid alkane properties and can match thermodynamic and structural properties, including solvation free energies, liquid densities, and liquid/vapor and liquid/water surface tensions for alkanes over a range of lengths. The results for long alkanes indicate that such models can be useful as accurate, yet efficient, coarse-grained potentials for macromolecules in water and other environments."

ABSTRACT = "Channelrhodopsins (ChR1 and ChR2) are light-activated ion channels that enable photomobility of microalgae from the genus Chlamydomonas. Despite common use of ChR2 in optogenetics for selective control and monitoring of individual neurons in living tissue, the protein structures remain unresolved. Instead, a crystal structure of the ChR chimera (C1C2), an engineered combination of helices I–V from ChR1, without its C-terminus, and helices VI–VII from ChR2, is used as a template for ChR2 structure prediction. Surprisingly few studies have focused in detail on the chimera. Here, we present atomistic molecular dynamics studies of the closed-state, non-conducting C1C2 structure and protonation states. A new and comprehensive characterization of interactions in the vicinity of the gating region of the pore, namely between residues E90, E123, D253, N258, and the protonated Schiff base (SBH), as well as nearby residues K93, T127, and C128, indicates that the equilibrated C1C2 structure with both E123 and D253 deprotonated closely resembles the available crystal structure. In agreement with experimental studies on C1C2, no direct or water-mediated hydrogen bonding between an aspartate and a cysteine (D156-O…S-C128) that would define a direct-current gate in C1C2 was observed in our simulations. Finally, we show that a single hydrogen bond between a glutamic acid (E90) and an asparagine (N258) residue suffices to keep the gate of C1C2 closed and to disable free water and ion passage through the putative pore, in contrast to the double bond proposed earlier for ChR2. We anticipate that this work will provide context for studies of both the gating process and water and ion transport in C1C2, and will spark interest in further experimental studies on the chimera."
